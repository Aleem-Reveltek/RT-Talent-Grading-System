 ### 1. IKIGAI: 
 Ikigai is not a quick-fix or immediate solution to a windy or unstable career path. It is meant to be a long-term practice, a means of exploring your purpose and identity. You should be searching for and fulfilling your ikigai every single day—and it may chance. The answers to those questions will come later and full circle, probably when you least expect it.

I will tell you how I answered the four ikigai questions, though:

I love when my writing helps people realize things they wouldn’t have realized on their own. I love writing to evoke emotion.

I’m good at being empathetic, listening to people’s stories and struggles while remaining neutral and open-minded.

I can be paid to write in a variety of ways (website articles, magazine features, eBooks, novels).

The world needs truth and relatability, especially on subjects that aren’t represented in the media.

The whole idea behind ikigai is finding out what makes you happy and keeps you motivated, but it goes deeper than that.

In essence, ikigai is a practical approach to figuring out that nagging question in the backs of our minds— What should I do with my life? —once and for all.
